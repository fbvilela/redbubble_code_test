Notes to self:

Still a lot of work to do:

pagination
twitter bootstrap? I don't want to spend time writing css for it. But not sure if styles is desired by the examiners
Rspec tests...
organise all these 'require' things

refactor, refactor, refactor,

better outputs and fail checks needed.

Got to the point where it works even though it's kinda rough

test if output folder is one of the project folders
test if output folder is empty
 Erase output folder

 About pagination
 will separate pages into divs that will be hidden/shown via javascript
